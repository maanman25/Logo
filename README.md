# SVG Logo Maker   

## Description

  Welcome to the SVG Logo Maker!<br />
  
  
  A place where simple logos are made in just a few questions!

  The SVG Logo Maker is an node.js based application for developers to create simple SVG logos to utilize in their own work.
  So, why? Why would any one person make such a simple program? Well, becuase its <span style="color:orange">c</span><span style="color:yellow">o</span><span style="color:orange">o</span><span style="color:yellow">l</span>, and why waste time developing one when one could be created by just answering a few questions?! Sweet Victory!

## Usage

Once the SVG Logo Maker is initiated, the user will be prompted with a series of questions. Those questions will ask the user information regarding the specifications of the logo. The user will encounter prompts with two different types of answer inputs: List and Text.<br /> 

- List Input
  - Ex: "Select a shape for the logo:" is going to display a list of shapes for the user to choose from. To choose the desired shape, use the arrow keys on a keyboard to channel through the options. After hovering over the choice that is correct, press the 'Enter" key.<br />

- Text Input
   - Ex: "Enter a shape color:" is looking for a text input from the user, and this should only hold one answer.

The application will assign the user's shape input to the correct shape object. The rest of the user's answers are included in the constructor's parameters to decide colors and text.<br />
Upon complete the prompts, the user's new SVG logo will placed in the "examples" folder, and the newly generated SVG file will be named "logo.svg".
Navigate to the folder, right click on the svg file, and select "Open with Live Server"!
